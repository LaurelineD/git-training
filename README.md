# Version Control, Git, GitHub and GitFlow

Keeping track of the evolution of documents, web sites, computer simulations, and other collections of informations is of paramount importance in the context of reproducible science. To facilitate this excruciating but yet necessary task, version control systems are widely used over the scientific community. These tools allows to track the history of a project and facilitate collaborative developments.

The most widespread version system is the called Git. It is a distributed and open-source software that has been developped by the father of Linux, Linua Torvalds. This tool can be used in either public repository (https://github.com/) and institutional repositories (such as Sourcesup, https://sourcesup.renater.fr/). 

The aim of the present talk is to introduce the importance of version control, discussing the advantages of Git and its main functionalities. The principal uses of GitHub around this context is going to be explained too. Finally, we are going to focus on the Git branching system by the use of Gitflow workflow to goal a fully exploits of branching.

The target audience is not only researchs that works around the use and developing of models but also public in general wich can take advantages of those tools in their works.
