Continuous integration
==========================

As code complexity grows, it is important to set-up tools that allow to automatically run a series of test. This is
the goal of [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions).

# Getting started

On your repository, click on the `Actions` button. You will come up on a page suggesting different GitHub Action templates depending on your project (Python, R, Java, etc.).
